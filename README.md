A project where I will practice my factory funtions and SOLID principles.

Todo list options:
Add item:
	props:
	-title
	-description
	-dueDate
	-priority (low, medium, high)
	-notes

Add folder where items can be added inside

Display folder/item in the main window (display a short list of props and have a button to expand to all information)
Rename or delete folder.
Modify item.

Also want the option to contain short one line todo's so just the title.

Looks:
menu/tools on the left side with the header resting on top of it. The rest of the contents to the right of Nav also with the header resting on top is the display.

menu/tools will have things like create item, create folder then in the main window we will see our item or folder
